***HORIESON REFACTORED WEBSITE***

*Description*
>This website has been refactored to make it more semantic, in other words, more accessible to more people.  It contains a header, a nav section, a main section with several articles, an aside, a footer, and last but not least a date on the bottom.  We want this site to be accessible to as broad of an audience as possible without changing anything in the way the website appears, so we hope that the changes made accomplish that.
